# Filtration
It can be used for filtration INT/REAL value while youre using relay, for example temperature. There is problem caused by temperature sensor becouse the sensor hasn't got fixed value like 22.15°C->22.19->22.35, but its variable like 22.19°C->22.15->22.31. So this filtration solves if you have required temperature 22.5°C it will slowly increase to this value.
